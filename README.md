# Snapmaker-J1S-Config
Configurations for Snapmaker J1/J1S Printer

 *Note: Tested extensively using Snapmaker Orca, but regular OrcaSlicer should result in the same gcode behavior.*

Copy each of these files into the respective code blocks under "Printer settings" --> "Machine G-Code". Everything else under machine can use the recommended settings from the J1 profile built into the slicer. I've made small tweaks there but nothing necessary.

Most of the modifications you should play with are for the process (walls, support gaps, speeds, etc). Happy printing!
